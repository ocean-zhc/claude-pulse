## The Problem

Ever run a complex task in Claude Code and wonder:
- *"Is this going to cost me $5 or $50?"*
- *"Why is my context suddenly at 95%?"*
- *"Did that tool call fail, or is it still running?"*

**Claude Pulse** gives you complete visibility into your AI coding sessions.

```

## Quick Start

**3 commands. That's it.**

```bash
# 1. Add the marketplace
/plugin marketplace add hyeongjun-dev/claude-pulse

# 2. Install
/plugin install claude-pulse

# 3. Setup
/claude-pulse:setup
```

The pulse starts immediately. No restart required.

### One-line install (terminal)

Already have the plugin installed? Wire the statusLine in one shot from your terminal — no need to enter Claude Code:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hyeongjun-dev/claude-pulse/main/plugins/claude-pulse/scripts/setup-statusline.sh | bash
```

The installer validates your existing `~/.claude/settings.json`, detects `bun` or `node`, prompts before replacing any non-claude-pulse statusLine, and writes atomically. Safe to re-run.

## Why I Built This

I've been using Claude Code daily for months. Great tool, but I had no visibility:
- No idea how much each session cost until the bill arrived
- Context would fill up without warning
- Couldn't tell if operations were succeeding or failing

So I built Claude Pulse — real-time monitoring for what matters.

## Feature Deep Dive

### Real-time Cost Tracking

Know exactly what you're spending:

```
💰 Cost: $0.42 (in: 89k, out: 4.2k, cache: 156k)
```

- Automatic model detection (Opus, Sonnet, Haiku)
- Detailed token breakdown (input, output, cache)

**Supported Models:**
| Model | Input | Output | Cache Read | Cache Write |
|-------|-------|--------|------------|-------------|
| Opus 4.5 | $15/M | $75/M | $1.50/M | $18.75/M |
| Sonnet 4 | $3/M | $15/M | $0.30/M | $3.75/M |
| Haiku 3.5 | $0.80/M | $4/M | $0.08/M | $1.00/M |

### Session Analytics

Track your productivity metrics:

```
📊 Tools: 47/49 (96%) | avg: 1.1s | top: Read:28, Edit:12
```

- Tool call success/failure rates
- Average operation duration
- Most-used tools ranking
- Error detection and tracking

### Smart Context Alerts

Never hit the context limit unexpectedly:

| Threshold | Alert Level | Action Suggested |
|-----------|-------------|------------------|
| 70% | Warning | "Consider summarizing soon" |
| 85% | Critical | "Use /compact or compress context" |
| 95% | Danger | "Immediate action required" |

Optional: Enable terminal bell sounds for critical alerts.

## Configuration

### Presets

Choose your starting point:

| Preset | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Full** | Everything on — cost, stats, alerts, all activity |
| **Essential** | Balanced — context, cost, key metrics |
| **Minimal** | Clean — just model and context percentage |

### Customize Anytime

```bash
/claude-pulse:configure
```

**All Options:**

```json
{
  "layout": "default",
  "display": {
    "showCost": true,
    "showStats": true,
    "showTools": true,
